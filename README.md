## How to run
Python 3.9.2 or newer is required (make sure PATH has path to Python and Python/Scripts)

Homebrew (tested on arm64 Mac):


Pip
Install all dependencies with pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run main.py with the appropriate Python interpreter:

`py main.py` or `python3 main.py` or `python3.9 main.py` etc.

If it doesn't run in a venv, try on the non-virtual Python

Linux may need `sudo apt update
sudo apt install libopengl0`
